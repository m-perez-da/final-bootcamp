# Project title: Predicting Producer Price Index in the European Union

Project about inflation, focused on commodities and Price Index (PPI). Trying to estimate future PPI using only a limited number of commodities.


### Motivation

Inflation rate in the European Union is at its highest levels for the last 30 years. High price increase in commodities is boosting inflation through the supply chain, and the first agents suffering this effect are the producers.

Producer Price Index (PPI) reflects the impact of price increases in producers. The idea is to use Machine Learning to explore if it is possible to predict future PPI based on current prices of commodities, but only using 7 of them:

    4 Energy commodities: 

        -> Natural Gas
        -> Crude Oil
        -> Coal
        -> Electricity
                       
    3 basic material commodities:

        -> Steel
        -> Copper
        -> Aluminum


### Development

Developed with Jupyter notebooks and Tableau.
